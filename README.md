**Steady state solution to heat/diffusion equation in 3D domain internally bounded by a cylinder and it's comparison to a sphere.**

1. Numerical scheme for steady state solution to heat/diffusion equation in 3D domain internally bounded by a cylinder.
2. Comparison study for cylinder and spherical geometry, and error analysis for assumption of considering a sphere shape for a cylinder(length=diameter).
3. Analytical solution to diffusion equation internally bounded by a sphere can be found.
